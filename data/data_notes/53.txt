scrumscrum is an agile framework for developing delivering and sustaining complex software products it is designed for small teams consisting of ten or less members
the work is broken down into goals and is completed within iterations these iterations are called sprints 

scrum roles

product owner the product owner facilitates communication and cooperation between the development team and its customers the product owner is responsible for ensuring that the customers expectations for the completed product have been communicated to the development team

scrum master the scrum master is responsible for ensuring that the best practices are carried out and there is a decent amount of progress

scrum development team the scrum development team is the product development team it is responsible for creating and testing incremental releases of the final product

scrum process

daily scrum a short meeting where the team reviews progress in the past  hours and plans for the next  hours

sprint planning meetings planning for the next sprint is done in this meeting

sprint review this meeting is held at the end of a sprint work that was completed and planned work that was not completed are reviewed

sprint retrospective this meeting is held at the end of a sprint it reflects upon the past sprint and the goal is continuous process improvement

scrum artefacts

product backlog the todo list for the entire product

sprint backlog the todo list for the current spring

product increment this refers to all that has been accomplished during the sprint

burndown the burndown is a visual representation of the amount of work that still needs to be completed

the three pillars of scrum are transparency inspection and adaptation these are supported by five values commitment courage focus openness and respect






lean development
lean software development lsd is an agile framework it emphasises on optimising development time and resources eliminating waste and delivering only what the product needs ie mvp minimum viable product

a team releases a bareminimum version of its product to the market learns from users what they like dont like and want to be added and then iterates based on this feedback

lean principles

       eliminate waste
       amplify learning
       decide as late as possible
       deliver as fast as possible
       empower the team
       build integrity in
       optimize the whole

lean development provides a streamlined approach that allows more functionality to be delivered in less time it eliminates unnecessary activity and empowers the development team to make decisions







extreme programming

extreme programming xp is an agile software development framework it aims to improve software quality and responsiveness to changing customer requirements 
activities

       coding
         a          the customer is always available
         b          code the unit test first
         c          all production code is pair programmed
         d          integrate often
         e          set up a dedicated integration computer
         f          collective ownership
       testing
         a          unit tests
         b          acceptance tests
       listening
         a          customer feedback
       designing
         a          simplicity
         b          no functionality is added early
         c          refactor whenever and wherever possible

values

       communication
       simplicity
       feedback
       courage
       respect

practices

       the planning game
       small releases
       metaphor
       simple design
       testing
       refactoring
       pair programming
       collective ownership
       continuous integration
       hour week
       onsite customer
       coding standard





adaptive software development asd
adaptive software development asd is a software development process it replaces the traditional waterfall cycle with a repeating series of speculate collaborate and learn cycles

 speculate
in this phase the planning is done and the project is initiated 

 collaborate
the second phase is about team collaboration people working together must trust each others to
   oo    criticize without animosity
   oo    assist without resentment
   oo    work as hard as possible
   oo    communicate problems to find an effective solution

 learning
this phase is about the team increasing its understanding of the product and related technologies learning process is of  ways
   oo    focus groups
   oo    technical reviews
   oo    project post mortem







feature driven development

feature driven development fdd is an agile framework that organizes software development around making progress on features


                             fdd project lifecycle
                                       
develop overall model
this phase is a highlevel walkthrough of the scope of the system and its context small teams create and peer review detailed domain models each modelling area and these models are progressively merged into an overall model

build feature list
the team creates a list of features to be added by functionally decomposing the domain into subject areas

plan by feature
a development plan is produced and features classes are assigned to programmers

design by feature
a chief programmer selects a small group of features that are to be developed within two weeks these features are implemented and a design inspection is held

build by feature
unit testing and code inspection is done after this the feature is added to the main product
