scrum 

scrum is an iterative process and incremental framework for product development as well as complex problems can be delivered at high possible value moreover it comes under an agile framework scrum has three main roles which is product owner scrum master and team 

scrum has a lightweight management process and its process consist of roles events and artifacts due to this scrum is a lightweight framework

scrum can choose the best way to accomplish work rather than being directed by someone other than the team  team members participating actively  collectively in all the scrum practices and events as well as it help the team to work together due to this reason scrum is selforganization

scrum framework is easy to understand and then will be able to follow the rules due to this feature scrum is easy to understand

working  brief

the product backlog is created which contain required items than the team will arrange accordingly  afterwords a sprint planning meeting to defining goles each member is assigned a small task a daily scrum meeting is done to achieve integrity  when every user is completed their work it means sprint is completed

advantages 
 scrum is fast and economic it follows the divide and concur its adeptive in nature 

disadvantages 
not allowed to change in sprint daily meeting requires resources if the project is not clear then it difficult to proceed





lean development
its an agile framework its based on optimised development time and resources and removing all waste and delivering what product needs some time it also known as minimal variable product in this product there is a minimum version is released and based on the feedback and reviews  add the features as per requirements 

lean development principal 

       eliminating waste  removing unnecessary thing whic do not contribute to development or add values to customer

       build quality  every team has a build quality of work 

       create knowledge  require discipline and focus to implement can be done using pair programming and code review documentation 

       defer commitment  it encourages team be responsible and always check for the option available 

       deliver fast  every team wants to deliver fast and put value into the customer hands

       respect for people  

       optimization  the most important part is to optimize the whole process without affecting the final product 

advantages 
remove unnecessary code delivered in time work satisfaction competitive in nature

disadvantages
low margin for error heavy workload 







extreme programming
 
its most important framework of agile software development framework
xp is used to build highquality products and a highquality life cycle of development

xp is used where dynamic changes in software are required small and colocated team fixed time  small project and project involve new tech in this area xp is used 

lifecycle 

planning  first stage of xp development life cycle  to set the goles of entire project and creat iterative cycles 

designing  teams define their main features of the future code and creat as simple design  and ofter share responsibility for the design of the code

coding  xp develops believe that a good code must be simple to understand  due to this refactor is done without affecting the final product 

testing  in xp testing is not done in after final or intermediate development rather it done along with the code written 

listing   at final stage must get feed back from customer and change according to that 

advantage 
fast development with the help of regular testing 
xp helps to increase customer satisfaction 
xp process is visible and accountable

disadvantage
 xp is not best option if programmers are separated
code quality is not measured







adeptive software development 

its a way to build complex software and system  is based on rda 
its aim to adept the changing requirements and market need 
asd is developed in three phases 
  
       speculate     collaborate       learn 
  in this phase project is initiated and planning is conducted
all the necessary info is collected requirements user need and all other things so that cycle can be created 

collaborate
collaborate communicate and teamwork and individual plays a major role in thinking
teamwork selfbelief work hard communicate
 

learning 
it helps to understand the overall project it divided into  parts focus group technical reviews  project postmortem 


advantages
focused on the end user to get the more better and intuitive produc
on time and early delivery
more transparency between developers and clients

disadvantages
testing at every stage which can increase total cost
 rapid iterating and continuous feedback can lead to scope creep









featuredriven development
is an iterative and incremental development processits a lightweight developing software its main purpose is to deliver tangible working software repeatedly in a timely manner

five phases planning 

 develop overall model  initialization of project  scope of the system and its context  and models created for each area 

building feature list   knowledge gathering during initial modeling to identify all the aspects and requirements and functional dependencies 

plan by features  when the feature list is completed its time to assign a task to programmers

design by features main programmer select groups and their task which need to be develop in week and with other programmes work on the sequential diagram
 

build by features  when successful design and inspected and after successful testing of code product is send to the main build


advantages 
works better for a large project 
simple process to develop rapid development
with the large team product move forward continuous success

disadvantages
not good for small projects 
less written documentation
high dependencies on programmers
