write short notes on following  
   oo 
      scrum
scrum is an agile project management methodology or framework scrum is widely used by software development teams with the goal of delivering new software capability every  weeks in fact its the most popular agile methodology scrum uses iterative process



advantage of using scrum framework 
   oo 
      fast moving 
   oo 
      money efficient
   oo 
      works by dividing the large product into small subproducts
   oo 
      customer satisfaction is given utmost importance
   oo 
      scrum is adaptive in nature due to short sprints
   oo 
      relies on constant feedback henceforth the quality of product increases in smaller amount of time

disadvantage of using scrum framework 
   oo 
      does not allow changes into their sprint
   oo 
      scrum framework is not a fully described model lots of details have to be filled in by the organization using the model
   oo 
      difficult for the scrum to plan structure and organize a project that lacks a clear definition
   oo 
      substantial resources are needed for daily scrum meetings 
components of agile scrum development 
   oo    scrum team 
   oo    scrum events
   oo    sprint
   oo    scrum artifacts
   oo    scrum rules
   oo     lean development

lean software development lsd is an agile framework
key points  
   oo    focuses on optimizing development time and resources
   oo    focuses on eliminating waste
   oo    deliver only what the product needs
in the lean approach a team releases a bareminimum version of its product to the market learns from users what they like dont like and want to be added and then iterates based on this feedback
the philosophy of lean development came from the manufacturing industry which originated the lean development process as a way to optimize production and assembly lines to minimize waste and maximize customer value 
strengths 
   oo 
      focused approach that allows more functionality to be delivered in less time
   oo 
      eliminates unnecessary activity hence reducing costs
   oo 
      empowers the development team to make decisions

weaknesses 
   oo 
      heavily depends on the team involved making it not as scalable as other frameworks
   oo 
      without strong documentation development mistakes can occur
an organization must have an outstanding development team and trust that team implicitly for this approach to be successful



   oo     extreme programming xp
extreme programming xp is one of the most important software development frameworks of agile models 
key points 
   oo    it is used to improve software quality
   oo    improve responsiveness to customer requirements 
   oo    encourages taking the best practices that have worked well in the past in program development projects to extreme levels
xp is based on the frequent iteration through which the developers implement user stories
      

good practices needs to practiced extreme programming some of the good practices that are suggested in xp are given below
   oo 
   code review code review detects and corrects errors efficiently
   oo 
   testing testing code helps to remove errors and improves its reliability xp suggests testdriven development tdd to continually write and execute test cases
   oo 
   incremental development includes gaining customer feedback and based on this development team come up with new increments every few days after each iteration
   oo 
   simplicity simplicity makes it easier to develop good quality code as well as to test and debug it
   oo 
   design good quality design is important to develop a good quality software so everybody should design daily
   oo 
   integration testing it helps to identify bugs at the interfaces of different functionalities 

applications of extreme programming xp some of the projects that are suitable to develop using xp model are given below
   oo 
   small projects xp model is very useful in small projects consisting of small teams as face to face meetings are easier to achieve
   oo 
   projects involving new technology or research projects this type of projects face changing requirements rapidly and technical problems so the xp model is used to complete this type of project


   oo     adaptive software development asd



adaptive software development is an agile methodology 

key traits 
   oo 
   helps in building complex software and systems
   oo 
   it focuses on human collaboration
   oo 
   focuses on selforganisation

asds overall emphasis on the dynamics of selforganizing teams interpersonal collaboration and individual and team learning help in creating software project teams that have a much higher likelihood of success

asd life cycle incorporates three phases namely
       speculation 
       collaboration
       learning
      

these are explained as follows 

 speculation
   oo 
   initiation of project and planning is conducted
   oo 
   information like project requirements user needs customer mission statement etc is gathered to define the set of release cycles that the project wants

 collaboration

for this phase to be successful workers needs to be motivated 

teamwork and collaboration are focussed on along with emphasizes on individual creativity people working together must trust each others to
   oo 
        criticize without animosity
   oo 
        assist without resentment
   oo 
        work as hard as possible
   oo 
        possession of skill set
   oo 
        communicate problems to find effective solutions

 learning

learning helps the workers to increase their level of understanding over the project and helps them in estimating the effort needed for the project completion correctly

learning process is of  ways
    
        focus groups
    
        technical reviews
    
        project post mortem
      
   oo     feature driven development
 featuredriven development is an agile iterative and incremental model it focuses on progressing the features of a software with each release it gives special emphasis on progress tracking and reporting so that timely working software can be delivered to the client

feature driven development life cycle includes various stages of development  
   oo 
        build overall model
   oo 
        build feature list
   oo 
        plan by feature
   oo 
        design by feature
   oo 
        build by feature

characteristics of fdd
   oo 
        short iterative simple and short iterations help to efficiently finish the work on time and assists faster product development
   oo 
        customer focused inspection of each feature is done by the client and before pushing to main build code
   oo 
        structured and feature focused more than  of efforts are given to the last  activities
   oo 
        frequent releases features are released continuously 

advantages of fdd
   oo 
        successful for larger size of teams and projects
   oo 
        reduction in risk as the whole model and design is built in smaller segments in the form of features
   oo 
        greater accuracy in cost estimation of the project

disadvantages of fdd
   oo 
        not good for smaller projects
   oo 
        high dependency on lead programmers designers and mentors
   oo 
        lack of documentation
