                                    scrum 
   oo    it is a framework to develop a complex product by keeping in view of majorly delivering and sustaining by emphasizing on teamwork accountability  iterative progress
   oo    it helps to make the products in some chinks and in iterations to follow according to the not stable market needs as well as the stringent goals of the organization
   oo    scrum team consists of mainly  roles a product owner a scrum master and the development team
         oo          product owner 
               oo                share the organizational view
               oo                handle the finance section of the businessproduct
         oo          development team 
               oo                self managed and mutual decision making
               oo                independent of other departments
               oo                usually small size teams
         oo          scrum master 
               oo                leader coaches the whole team
               oo                help in eliminating the obstacles
               oo                identifies ways to collaborate and keep security
   oo    artifacts of a scrum  backlog of the product  sprint product increment and to consider what is done
   oo    activities in scrum basics  product backlog refinement sprint planning daily scrum sprint review and sprint retrospective


                               lean development
                                       
   oo    a methodology to get better results by spending least time on development
   oo    works on gathering important in the development model by doing multiple iterations
   oo    there are majorly  principles of lean development and it can be implemented in any idea and environment and can drastically improve the existing programming workflows
   oo    the  principles are 
      
      removing what isnt of value to the customer
       

      allow the frontline workers ie development to make the major decisions
      
      
      quicker delivery of results with quicker feedback

      
      view the software as a whole and not as a sum of its parts system thinking
      
      build for perceived customer view conceptual system view integrity flexibility and efficiency
      
      
      delay and defer decisions until assumptions become fact


      improve software development by improving the process through learning
      
      
                              extreme programming xp
                                          
         oo          an agile development methodology usually for small to medium sized teams developing software in the face of vague or rapidly changing requirements
         oo          it was created by kent beck in the mid s
         oo          in this basically a set of  key practices are to be taken to their extremes
         oo          it basically works by uniting the whole team in the simple practices so that there would be enough feedback for the improvement in their specific domain with their unique situation
         oo          the four core values of xp are communication simplicity feedback and courage
         oo          it is called a light weight process because of the following reasons 
               oo                since customers want up the front not the lot of information nailing down so xp works on plenty of feedback
               oo                it keeps the customer involved by embracing change ie iterate often design and redesign code and test frequently
               oo                in only a short period of time say  weeks by doing short iterations the product is delivered to the customer for feedback
               oo                one of the major features is the reduced cost since it eliminates the defects early



                         adaptive software development

   oo    it was originally proposed by jim highsmith and sam bayer
   oo    it is a collaborative approach to managing complex systems
   oo    it embodies the principles that continuous adaptation of the process to the work at hand is the normal state of affairs
   oo    its distinguishing and important features are 
         oo          missiondriven planning
         oo          component based focus
         oo          uses timeboxing
         oo          explicit consideration of risks
   oo    it is like the evolutionary model  because of its cyclical structure with the phases names reflecting the unpredictability in the complex systems which are 
         oo          spectuate
         oo          collaborate
         oo          learn
            


                          feature driven development
   oo    it blends a number of industryrecognized best practices into a cohesive whole including domain object modeling feature teams and version control
   oo    the best practices that make up fdd are 
         oo          domain object modeling
         oo          developing by feature
         oo          individual class code ownership
         oo          feature teams
         oo          inspections
         oo          regular builds
         oo          configuration management
         oo          reportingvisibility of results
   oo    in short it is a framework following agile methods organizing software development around making progress on features


more shape than    a list of features  a development             a design    completed 
  content grouped into sets   plan class owners        package    client
            and subject areas      feature set owners     valued
    function
