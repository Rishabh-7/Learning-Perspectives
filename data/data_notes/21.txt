question write short notes on following

       scrum
      scrum is the type of agile framework in this framework people can address complex adaptive problems while the delivered product is at the highest possible values of creativity and productivity it uses iterative process
      scrum is simple to understand lightweighted organizes self organization and helps the team to work together
      advantages
         oo          it is fast moving and cost efficient
         oo          customer satisfaction
         oo          increases quality of product in less time due to feedback
         oo          it uses divide and conquer strategy
disadvantages
         oo          scrum framework doesnt allow changes in their sprint
         oo          it is difficult for scrum to plan structure and organize a project that lacks a clear definition
         oo          daily scrum meetings and reviews require a lot of resources
lifecycle 
         oo          sprint it is a time box of a month or less after completion of previous sprint the sprint starts  immediately
         oo          release product goes to this stage after completion
         oo          sprint review if the product has non achievable features it is checked at this stage and passed to sprint retrospective stage
         oo          sprint retrospective here status and quality of product is checked
         oo          product backlog according to the prioritize features the product is organized
         oo          sprint backlog sprint backlog is divided into two parts product assigned features to sprint and sprint planning meeting

       lean development
      lean software development is an agile framework based on optimizing development time and resources eliminating waste and furtherly delivering only what the product needs it uses minimum viable product mvp strategy in which the team releases the product with minimum features and learns what the users like and dont like and want to be added therefore iterates on the feedback
      advantages
         oo          reduces cost by removing unnecessary activities
         oo          development team makes the decision boosting their morale
         oo          more functionality to be delivered in less time due to streamlined approach
disadvantages
         oo          heavily dependent on the team involved therefore not scalable
         oo          depends on strong documentation

       extreme programming xp
      it is one of the most important software development frameworks of agile models this model recommends best practices in past program development projects to extreme levels it is used to improve software quality and response to customer needs
      applications small projects and projects involving new technology or research projects
      practices for extreme programming 
         oo          code review detects and corrects errors with the help of pair programming
         oo          testing removes errors and improves reliability by use of test cases
         oo          incremental development development on the basis of customer feedback
         oo          simplicity easier to develop code as well as test and debug it
         oo          design good quality design is required for good quality code
         oo          integration testing helps to identify bugs of different functionalities
      basic principles
      xp is based on frequent iterations through which developers can implement user stories user story is the description of functionality required by the customer
      basic activities in xp include
         oo          coding it includes modeling that will be transformed into code
         oo          testing to develop a fault free software testing is required
         oo          listening to customers needs to develop a good quality product
         oo          designing it helps to reduce complexity and reduces maintenance expense
         oo          feedback understanding the customers needs through contacting them
         oo          simplicity makes projects simple and less time consuming it focused on specific features which are needed immediately rather than future requirements
      
       adaptive software development asd
      asd is a method to build complex software and system asd focuses on human collaboration and selforganisation
      the life cycle has  phases  
                   speculation project is initialized in this phase requirements user needs etc are taken into consideration to formulate a plan and define a set of release cycles
                   collaboration it collaborates communication and teamwork but emphasizes individualism as individual creativity plays a major role in creative thinking people working together must trust each others to criticize without animosity assist without resentment work as hard as possible possession of skill set communicate problems to find effective solution
                   learning it helps to increase the workers level of understanding for the project with the help of focus groups technical reviews and project postmortem
       feature driven development
      it is an agile iterative and incremental model that focuses on progressing the features of the development software its aim is to deliver timely updated and working software to the client in fdd reporting and progress tracking is necessary at all levels
      life cycle
         oo          building overall model
         oo          building feature list
         oo          plan by feature
         oo          design by feature
         oo          build by feature
characteristics
         oo          short iterative simple and short iterations gives good pace for large projects
         oo          customer focused inspection of each feature by client
         oo          structured and feature focussed
         oo          frequent releases
advantages
         oo          easy progress tracking due to reporting at each level
         oo          provides continuous success for large size teams and projects
         oo          risk reduction
         oo          it provides greater accuracy in estimation of cost
disadvantages
         oo          not good for smaller projects
         oo          high dependency on lead programmers designers and mentors
         oo          there is lack of documentation which can cause issues afterwards
