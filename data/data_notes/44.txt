  scrum

      scrum is an agile framework in which it is believed that the team doesnt know everything at the start of a project and will learn through a continuous process of learning it is a heuristic framework where the developers team addresses complex problems their aim is to deliver a product which has good productivity and creativity it uses an iterative process with short release cycles so that the teams can learn and improve from changing conditions and user requirements

salient features of scrum
   oo 
   the framework supports collaboration and self organization of work
   oo 
   the team work closely to develop the project
   oo 
   scrum team self managers the activities within the timebox

scrum roles
   oo 
   scrum master  scrum is initiated by a scrum master who is responsible for removing obstacles for the team and defining the product goals
   oo 
   product owner  the product owner represents the products stakeholder who is responsible for delivering good business results
   oo 
   development team  the development team has  to  members who carry out all the implementations required to build and develop every sprint goal

scrum ceremonies
   oo 
   sprint a sprint has a timebox of one month or less after the completion of the previous sprint a new sprint starts immediately with a new goal
   oo 
   sprint planning  at the beginning of a sprint the scrum team holds a sprint planning event to have a short description of what they are going to deliver at the end of the sprint product backlog etc
   oo 
   daily scrum  during the daily scrum each team member typically answers three questions which are  what did i complete yesterday what do i plan to complete today and do i see any impediment in the sprint goal
   oo 
   sprint review in this stage the unachievable features of the product are checked  and then the product is passed onto the sprint retrospective stage
   oo 
   sprint retrospective quality of the product is analysed in this stage
   oo 
   product backlog the product is organized according to the priority features
   oo 
   sprint backlog product assigned features to sprint and sprint planning meeting are two parts of sprint backlog

advantages of scrum 
   oo 
        scrum framework is fast and cost efficient
   oo 
        it divides the larger product into various smaller subproducts
   oo 
        constant feedback taken by the scrum framework increases the quality of the product

      

disadvantages of scrum
   oo 
        scrum framework doesnt allow modifications in sprint goals
   oo 
        it lacks a described model 
   oo 
        it is difficult to plan organize and structure a project that doesnt have a  clear understanding of what the project does and so on







 lean software development

      lean software development is an agile framework based on optimizing development time and resources eliminating waste and fulfilling the products requirements the lean approach is also known as the minimum viable product  strategy as the team first develops a bareminimum version of the product which can be supplied to the market takes the feedback from the users learns from users feedback and then proceeds further based on the inferences that is gained from the feedback

      

principles to lean software development
         oo 
         eliminating waste  remove everything which is not adding value to the customer such as partially done work extra features relearning task switching waiting handoffs defects management activities
         oo 
         building quality in  this principle is to ensure that quality is maintained all along the process
         oo 
         amplifying knowledge  lean teams are encouraged to provide the proper document and retain valuable learning
         oo 
         delaying commitment   the team is encouraged to demonstrate in a responsible manner they do so by keeping their options open and continuously collecting information decisions are not taken without referring to the necessary data
         oo 
         delivering fast  this principle follows this concept  build a simple solution bring it to the customers and potential users modify incrementally based on customer feedback
         oo 
         respecting people  lean development teams are encouraged to have proactive communication healthy conflicts empowering team members
         oo 
         optimizing the whole thing  lean principles aim to achieve higher performance by optimizing the teams workflow creating a sense of unity among the team and giving a sense of shared responsibility and shared objectives

            

advantages of lean software development
         oo 
         allows more functionality to be done in less time
         oo 
         eliminates unnecessary activity which reduces the costs
         oo 
         allows continuous feedback to have a better product at the end 

            

disadvantages of lean software development
         oo 
         highly dependent on the team
         oo 
         non scalable
         oo 
         depends on a strong documentation

      

      

      







  extreme programming

      extreme programming is one of the key software development frameworks of agile models it is used to improve the quality of the software and to be more responsive to customer requirements 

      

principles of extreme programming  
   oo 
        coding in extreme programming coding activity includes drawing diagrams that will be used for coding scripting a webbased system etc 
   oo 
        testing testing is considered as the primary factor to develop a faultfree software hence model gives high importance on testing
   oo 
        listening the developers carefully listen to the customers requirements and note it down so as to develop good quality software 
   oo 
        designing a good design results in the elimination of complex dependencies within a system so in extreme programming the effective use of suitable design is emphasized
   oo 
        feedback frequent feedback is taken from customers to understand the exact customer needs and to make the development effective
   oo 
        simplicity the main principle of the xp model is to develop a simple system instead of a larger complex system the system is made to work efficiently it focuses on some specific features that are immediately needed in the present time





advantages of extreme programming
   oo 
   it saves costs and time required for project development 
   oo 
   constant feedback is the key of framework
   oo 
   simplicity is another advantage of extreme programming

disadvantages of extreme programming
   oo 
   rather than on design extreme programming is focused more on the code
   oo 
   extreme programming does not measure code quality

























  adaptive software development

      adaptive software development is an agile framework which is based on rapid application development the objective is to enable the teams to adapt to the changing requirements in an efficient manner and evolve their products with a little bit of planning and continuous learning



adaptive software development phases
         oo 
         speculation this phase is known as the planning phase the plan includes information like project requirements user needs etc to define a goal of each release cycle
         oo 
         collaboration it is a phase which includes collaborative communication and teamwork but it majorly emphasizes on individualism as individual creativity plays a major role in creative thinking people working together must trust each other to criticize without animosity assist without resentment work as hard as possible possess a skill set communicate problems to find effective solutions
         oo 
         learning learning helps the workers to increase their level of understanding over the projectlearning process is conducted in  major ways which are 
               oo 
               focus groups
               oo 
               technical feedback
               oo 
               project design and learning

      

advantages of adaptive software development
   oo 
   focused on the end users which can lead to better products
   oo 
   allows ontime and even early delivery
   oo 
   encourages closed communication between developers and clients



disadvantages of adaptive software development
   oo 
   demands extensive user involvement which is difficult to facilitate
   oo 
   integrates testing into every stage which increases the cost
   oo 
   focus on rapid iterating and continuous feedback can lead to scope creep



      



















  feature driven development

      feature driven development is an agile framework which focuses on organizing software development around making progress on features features in the fdd are not referred to as product features rather they are the user stories in scrum 

characteristics of fdd
   oo 
        short iterative to finish the work on time along with efficiency this lifecycle works in simple and short iterations
   oo 
        customer focused this agile practice is totally based on user feedback feedback of  each feature given by the potential users and customers is taken into account before pushing the code to the main build
   oo 
        structured and feature focused adhoc activities in lifecycle includes  building the domain model and features list
   oo 
        frequent releases featuredriven development provides continuous releases of features and retains continuous success of the project

      

lifecycle in feature driven development
         oo 
         gather data  the first step is to gain understanding of the project target audience and their needs
         oo 
         develop overall model  the team will develop detailed domain models which are then used to build an overall model that acts as a rough outline of the system
         oo 
         build feature list  uses the information collected in the first step to create a list of the required features
         oo 
         plan by feature  analyze the complexity of each feature specific roles are defined and plan tasks that are related for team members to accomplish
         oo 
         design by feature  the feature are determine that will be designed and build
         oo 
         build by feature  this step implements all the necessary items that will support the design
            

advantages of feature driven development
   oo 
   allows progress tracking of projects
   oo 
   allows scaling of team and projects
   oo 
   allows multiple test to work together



disadvantages of feature driven development
   oo 
   does not work efficiently for smaller projects
   oo 
   poor documentation
   oo 
   highly dependent on lead developers
