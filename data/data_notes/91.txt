write short notes on the following
 scrum

scrum is a process framework used to manage product development and other knowledge work  scrum is empirical in that it provides a means for teams to establish a hypothesis of how they think something works try it out reflect on the experience and make the appropriate adjustments  that is when the framework is used properly
scrum is structured in a way that allows teams to incorporate practices from other frameworks where they make sense for the teams context
scrum is best suited in the case where a cross functional team is working in a product development setting where there is a nontrivial amount of work that lends itself to being split into more than one      week iteration
the following principles underpin the empirical nature of scrum
transparency
the team must work in an environment where everyone is aware of what issues other team members are running into 
inspection
frequent inspection points built into the framework to allow the team an opportunity to reflect on how the process is working these inspection points include the daily scrum meeting and the sprint review meeting
adaptation
the team constantly investigates how things are going and revises those items that do not seem to make sense

  lean development
lean software development lsd is an agile framework based on optimizing development time and resources eliminating waste and ultimately delivering only what the product needs the lean approach is also often referred to as the minimum viable product strategy in which a team releases a bareminimum version of its product to the market learns from users what they like dont like and want to be added and then iterates based on this feedback
lsds strengths include
   oo    streamlined approach allows more functionality to be delivered in less time
   oo    eliminates unnecessary activity and as a result can reduce costs
   oo    empowers the development team to make decisions which can also boost morale
lsds weaknesses include
   oo    heavily depends on the team involved making it not as scalable as other frameworks
   oo    depends on strong documentation and failure to do so can result in development mistakes
    extreme programming xp


extreme programming xp is one of the most important software development framework of agile models it is used to improve software quality and responsive to customer requirements the extreme programming model recommends taking the best practices that have worked well in the past in program development projects to extreme levels

 some of the good practices that have been recognized in the extreme programming model and suggested to maximize their use are given below
   oo 
        code review code review detects and corrects errors efficiently it suggests pair programming as coding and reviewing of written code carried out by a pair of programmers who switch their works between them every hour
   oo 
        testing testing code helps to remove errors and improves its reliability xp suggests testdriven development tdd to continually write and execute test cases in the tdd approach test cases are written even before any code is written
   oo 
        incremental development incremental development is very good because customer feedback is gained and based on this development team come up with new increments every few days after each iteration
   oo 
        simplicity simplicity makes it easier to develop good quality code as well as to test and debug it
   oo 
        design good quality design is important to develop a good quality software so everybody should design daily
   oo 
        integration testing it helps to identify bugs at the interfaces of different functionalities extreme programming suggests that the developers should achieve continuous integration by building and performing integration testing several times a day
   adaptive software development asd


adaptive software development is a method to build complex software and systems asd focuses on human collaboration and selforganisation asd life cycle incorporates three phases which are explained below

 speculation

during this phase project is initiated and planning is conducted the project plan uses project initiation information like project requirements user needs customer mission statement etc to define set of release cycles that the project wants

 collaboration

it is the difficult part of asd as it needs the workers to be motivated it collaborates communication and teamwork but emphasizes individualism as individual creativity plays a major role in creative thinking people working together must trust each others to
   oo 
        criticize without animosity
   oo 
        assist without resentment
   oo 
        work as hard as possible
   oo 
        communicate problems to find effective solutions

 learning

the workers may have a overestimate of their own understanding of the technology which may not lead to the desired result learning helps the workers to increase their level of understanding over the project


 feature driven development

fdd is a modeldriven and shortiteration process that was developed around software engineering best practices including domain object modeling developing by feature and code ownership
featuredriven development begins with the establishment of an overall model that is expected to result in the feature list these features are usually small yet useful and effective on the users eyes due to this tactic of product development large teams are allowed to move products forward with a regular success that matters for the clients
the general objective of fdd is to deliver concrete and flexible software in a short time its greatest advantage is that the process is scalable even for large teams as a result fdd is considered to be an effective solution to support the control of comparatively complex agile projects

advantages of featuredriven development
   oo 
   gives the team a very good understanding of the projects scope and context
   oo 
   requires fewer meetings one of the frequent complaints about agile is that there are too many meetings scrum uses the daily meetings to communicate fdd uses documentation to communicate
   oo 
   uses a usercentric approach with scrum the product manager is usually considered the end user with fdd the client is the end user
   oo 
   works well with largescale longterm or ongoing projects
