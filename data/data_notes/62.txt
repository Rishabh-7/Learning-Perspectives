scrum
scrum is a framework that closely follows the principles of agile development it can be
used in all types of work which requires teamwork but usually it is utilised in software
development scrum enables the team to develop products eectively and precisely
along with a retrospection at end that further reflects on their wins and losses to boast
continuous improvement
it all starts with a list of product backlogs which is basically a todo list for the project
this list may include new features or improvements and even bug fixes for the product
the product manager along with the development team sets the tasks that need to be
done in the next few weeks by taking into account the financial and competitive edge
completion would provide the tasks that are chosen from the backlog are called as
sprint backlogs this whole process is termed as sprint planning after successful
completion of planning a sprint starts sprint is the actual time period when the scrum
team works together to finish an increment two weeks is a pretty typical length for a
sprint however its not strict and can be changed according to needs during the sprint a
daily scrum or standup is organised which is a short meeting that happens at the same
time usually mornings and place to keep it simple this is the place where one can raise
their concerns or any blockers that they may face many teams try to complete the
meeting in  minutes but thats just a guideline this meeting is also called a daily
standup emphasising that it needs to be a quick one the goal of the daily scrum is for
everyone on the team to be on the same page aligned with the sprint goal and to get a
plan out for the next  hours
at the end of the sprint the team gets together for a review where they discuss their
sprint results and showcases it to the product ownermanager and teammates for
feedback the product owner can decide whether or not to release the increment
although in most cases the increment is released this is also the stage where the
stakeholders plan on for the next sprint based on the results of the current sprint

lastly a sprint retrospective is held where the team comes together to discuss what
worked and what didnt it encourages the team to be open about various aspects such
as relationships tools ideas etc this helps to improve the team as a whole for the
upcoming sprint

extreme programming
extreme programming xp is one of the most important software development
techniques in the agile models it is most suitable for projects which have continuously
changing requirements the main characteristics of xp include dynamically changing
software requirements using a small collocated extended development team and
leveraging technology that facilitates automated unit and functional tests
xp is based on the frequent iteration through which the developers implement user
stories user stories are requirements that are asked by the customermanager from the
developer it is an informal statement rather than being a full srs this gives a vague idea
of the product to be developed by the developer on capturing user stories the team
moves on to develop a high level model of how the system will work also know as
metaphor afterwards the development team may decide to build a spike for some
feature a spike is a very simple program that is constructed to explore the suitability of a
solution being proposed it can be considered similar to a prototype
xp is mainly helpful in small projects consisting of small team as it makes it easier for the
team to discuss problems it has been also proved eective for research projects which
require changing of requirements swiftly

lean development
lean development is yet another agile method for software development it originated
from the principle of production line used in manufacturing goods similar to a
production line lean development follows a repeatable process and guarantees quality
checks for the final product also it relies on the collaboration of ones coworkers or
specialised workers lean development is based on  underlying principles that are








eliminate waste
build quality in
create knowledge
defer commitment
deliver fast
respect people
optimise the whole

eliminate waste this process requires the team to get rid of any task that doesnt add
value to the product or somehow hinders the development of the project some things
that falls under this category are manufacturing things that are not required now use
complicated tools that could have been done by simpler means unnecessary code or
functionality

build quality in this phase focuses on improving the quality of the product without
overdoing the testing ie coming up with quality issues that arent even actual issues to
enable a good quality there are certain mechanisms already in place
 pair programming getting two developers instead of one to work on a single unit
of product
 testdriven development writing code that meets the given requirement and
meeting the requirement being sole focus when writing code
 automation eliminate repetitive work done by developers and replacing it with
automation
create knowledge this step requires developers to create documentation for the work
they have been doing to reduce knowledge gaps and train fellow teammates
defer commitment this lean principle encourages team to demonstrate responsibility
by keeping their options open and continuously collecting information rather than making
decisions without the necessary data
deliver fast it focuses on delivering the product as fast as possible to the customer for
feedback this does not imply that developers work more hours but rather work more
eciently and customer centric
respect people the lean principle of respect for people is often one of the most
neglected especially in the fastpaced burnoutridden world of software development it
applies to every aspect of the way lean teams operate from how they communicate
handle conflict hire and onboard new team members deal with process improvement
and more

adaptive software development asd
adaptive software development is a method to build complex software and system
asd focuses on human collaboration and selforganisation asd life cycle incorporates
three phases namely
 speculation
during this phase project is initiated and planning is conducted the project plan uses
project initiation information like project requirements user needs customer mission
statement etc to define set of release cycles that the project wants
 collaboration
it is the dicult part of asd as it needs the workers to be motivated it collaborates
communication and teamwork but emphasises individualism as individual creativity plays
a major role in creative thinking people working together must trust each others to
criticise without animosity assist without resentment work as hard as possible
possession of skill set communicate problems to find eective solution
 learning
the workers may have an overestimate of their own understanding of the technology
which may not lead to the desired result learning helps the workers to increase their
level of understanding over the project

feature driven development
feature driven development fdd is an agile framework that organises software
development around making progress on features it conducts upfront planning design
and documentation and relies very heavily upon domain modelling fdd also uses feature
teams with chief architects programmers and traditional codeownership and codereview as opposed to pairprogramming and refactoring in contrast to scrum fdd
focuses to develop small feature sets in one to two weeks iterations like other agile
methods this method has its own set of best practices as given below

 drawing a high level diagram of how the feature is to be implemented saves time by


helping you uncover what function to add for each feature
if a feature is more time consuming ie more than  weeks it can be broken down into
small pieces to accommodate  weeks timeline
instead of pair programming each class or group of code is given to a single owner
periodic inspections are held within the team to uncover faultsbugs
regular check for successful builds ie ensure that the project is building fine after
each alteration to the project
project managers should provide frequent progress reports of completed work

advantages of featuredriven development

 gives the team a very good understanding of the projects scope and context
 uses documentation to communicate thus eliminating the need of daily meetings as in
scrum

 uses a usercentric approach with scrum the product manager is usually considered
the end user with fdd the client is the end user

 breaks feature sets into smaller chunks and regular iterative releases which makes it
easier to track and fix coding errors reduces risk and allows you to make a quick
turnaround to meet your clients needs
