scrum
scrum is an agile process that is used for developing and
maintaining complex projects used primarily in the development of
software
it consists of multiple development iterations of fixed length called
sprints these sprints generally last for one to two weeks each the
aim of these fixed length sprints is to ensure some feature is
shipped at the end of each cycle the team can then decide what
features are to be shipped in the next sprint
scrum consists of a fixed set of responsibilities meetings and roles
that do not change the roles of scrum include
 product owner
 scrum team
 scrum master
the product owner is responsible for having a view of the entire
project and conveying the same to the team members the
product owner focuses on business as well as market requirements
and lays down a priority for the work that needs to be done
handling the backlog and providing guidance on what feature to
ship next are also responsibilities of the product owner
the scrum team comprises of five to ten members each of the
members of the scrum team work together without any designated
roles like tester and developer they plan together for what features
to ship in the next sprint by estimating what work they can
complete in the next iteration
the scrum master can often be considered the coach of the team
and helps the team do their best possible work together they work

closely with the product owner to ensure the product backlog is
ready for the next sprint other responsibilities of the scrum master
are organising meetings and dealing with issues the team mightve
encountered

some of the advantages of a scrum based approach include
 increased accountability of the team as the team themselves
decide what work they will be completing in the next sprint
thus reducing the possibilities of micromanagement from the
project manager
 constant communication between the team members ensure
that all team members are aware of all existing issues and
changes made
 developing and testing features in small modules makes it
easier to receive constant feedback and reduces the cost of
fixing mistakes
 daily standup meetings ensure the entire team knows what
each team member is doing thus reducing the possibility of
confusion problems may be identified in earlier stages of
development and are thus easier to resolve

lean development
the concept of lean development was initially introduced by toyota
to bring reductions in wastage in their manufacturing process but
was soon adopted by it companies for their development
processes lean development in short implies removing all
unnecessary things from the development cycle

lean development is made possible by applying the following
seven principles
 elimination of waste this is the most important principle in lean
development elimination of waste includes improvements like
removal of unnecessary code unclear requirements tasks in
the backlog that cannot be completed in time issues with
quality duplication of data and features that arent required
 ecient management of quality repeated code testing issues
in logging and resolving these issues can significantly increase
the cost of development and thus must be addressed these
issues may be tackled by using pair programming completing
each task in pairs and test driven development writing unit
tests before code
 amplification of knowledge the amplification of knowledge is
carried out through code reviews establishing metrics from
data that are crossteam and meetings
 delaying commitment this implies that all irreversible
decisions are delayed as much as possible to leave room for
improvement as there is usually a change in requirements
further down the development cycle
 delivering fast the concept of mvp or minimum viable
product is used to ensure all unnecessary features are kept out
of the development cycle thus reducing complexity and
enhancing delivery speed of critical features
 respecting team lean development aims to empower team
members instead of micromanaging them this helps improve
motivation and trust among members
 optimising complete stream lean development aims at
optimisation of entire systems rather than a part by part
optimisation of the system by dierent teams this results in a
higher understanding of the entire system and its working and
thus higher throughput

extreme programming
extreme programming xp is a development method created to
improve the quality of the software developed and its ability to
adapt to any requirement changes down the development cycle
just like agile extreme programming aims to provide iterative and
frequent small releases allowing both the team members and
clients to review the projects progress throughout the development
lifecycle
extreme values
these are  fundamental values that define how the entire extreme
programming paradigm is created the  values are
 simplicity
 communication
 feedback
 respect
 courage
extreme rules
the set of rules for extreme programming were designed to
counter the claims that extreme programming will not be a viable
option in modern software development these rules are
summarised below
 planning writing user stoties making frequent releases
dividing the project into iterations etc
 managing setting a sustainable pace measuring project
velocity giving the team a good work space etc
 designing simplicity not adding any functionality early
refactoring whenever possible etc

 coding pair programming integrating often collective
ownership test driven development etc
 testing all modules must have unit tests all modules must
pass their unit tests before they are pushed into production
more tests are created when a bug is found etc

extreme practices
created using what were considered the best practices of software
development at the time these twelve extreme programming best
practices detail the specific procedures that should be followed
when implementing a project using extreme programming
 pair programming
 planning game
 test driven development
 whole team
 continuous integration
 code refactoring
 small releases
 coding standards
 collective code ownership
 simple design
 system metaphor
 sustainable pace

adaptive software development
adaptive software development refers to the software development
methodology of adding new features iteratively and incrementally
to a complex project while heavily factoring in the feedback
received the feedback is generally obtained from the client in

other words this approach aims to improve the solution based on
continuous input received from the client
this is a preferred approach over traditional development models
as it leaves scope for improvement and does not focus on creating
a solution in one go and delivering it to the client modern business
environments are highly dynamic in nature and there is a need to
maintain some wiggle room to incorporate all of the changing
requirements this allows the software solution to be modified
according to the changing needs of the client
there are  stages in adaptive software development lifecycle
 speculate
 collaborate
 learn
speculate is the project planning phase where the development
team thoroughly understand the set of requirements of the client
this phase covers all of the tasks that need to be performed to
complete the project along with determining the deadline for each
collaborate is the stage where the development team works
together to accomplish the tasks determined in the speculation
phase this phase also includes continuous communication with
the client
learn is the stage where a prototype of the software with the
newly added feature is deployed and given to the client for testing
the client then shares their feedback with the development team
for further speculation and improvement

feature driven development
feature driven development or fdd is an approach that
promotes software development with close involvement of the
product owner and all of the stakeholders of the project
fdd was designed from scratch while keeping in mind larger
teams as working with larger teams poses its own challenges that
must be tackled for ecient throughput
fdd consists of five processes the first three of which are
equivalent to iteration zero or initial projectwide activities that
help the development team put into place whatever they need to
start delivering clientvalued functionality in subsequent iterations
the five processes in feature driven development are






developing an overall model
building a features list
planning by feature
designing by feature
building by feature

building an initial object model in feature driven development is a
highly collaborative and iterative approach the main idea behind
the same is for both the development and domain members of the
development team gain a good understanding of the problem they
are trying to solve
after a model is developed a feature list must be defined a feature
can be denoted by the form action result object a feature
typically takes  days to implement occasionally extending to 
days
the third fdd process planning by feature involves making an
initial schedule and assigning responsibilities in the team the
feature list is given an order or sequence in which the features will
be incorporated this sequence may be adjusted later on in the
development life cycle based on the input obtained from the client

fdd focuses on individual code ownership rather than the
collective code ownership that extreme programming aims at this
is because it may become harder to truly collectively maintain code
ownership in large teams working on large projects the pros of
feature driven development are that it is driven from a functionality
perspective its main purpose is to deliver software repeatedly in a
timely manner by creating a prioritised feature list and plan
development based on the same
