q write short notes on the following
   oo     scrum
            scrum is a lightweight agile project management framework that can be used to
            manage iterative and incremental projects of all types due to its simplicity proven 
            productivity and ability to incorporate various overarching practices promoted by other 
            agile methods it has gained immense popularity over the years  
            characteristics
       scrum is the best choice when the exact amount of work cant be estimated and the release date is not fixed as scrum works well for long term complex projects that require stakeholder feedback
       a scrum team comprising  people does not include any of the traditional software engineering roles everyone on the project works together to complete the set of work they have collectively committed to complete within a sprint 
       in scrum product owner someone from product management or marketing a key stakeholder or a key user usually works closely with the scrum team to identify and prioritize system functionality by creating a product backlog
       the product backlog consists of whatever needs to be done to successfully deliver a working software system including features bug fixes nonfunctional requirements etc
       at the start of each sprint a sprint planning meeting is held during which the product owner presents the top items on the product backlog to the team the work to be completed in the coming sprint is then moved from the product backlog to a sprint backlog
       once a sprints product backlog is committed no additional functionality can be added to the sprint except by the team
       once a sprint has been delivered the product backlog is analyzed and reprioritized if necessary and the next set of deliverables is selected for the next sprint
      
   oo     lean development
       lean development is an iterative agile methodology that focuses the team on delivering
       value to the customer through effective value stream mapping it is a highly flexible
      evolving methodology without rigid guidelines rules or methods
      characteristics
       lean development eliminates waste by asking users to select only the truly valuable features for a system prioritize those features and then work to deliver them in small batches 
       lean development uses the idea of a work product being pulled via customer request
       it relies on rapid and reliable feedback between programmers and customers emphasizing the speed and efficiency of development workflows  
       it gives decisionmaking authority to individuals and small teams since this has been proven to be a faster and more efficient method than a hierarchical flow of control    
       lean development strongly recommends that automated unit tests be written at the same time the code is written
       it concentrates on the efficient use of team resources trying to ensure that everyone is as productive as possible for the maximum amount of time
      
   oo     extreme programming xp
       extreme programming is a disciplined approach for highquality agile software
       development focused on speed and continuous delivery it is intended to improve 
       software quality and responsiveness in the wake of changing customer requirements 
       characteristics
       extreme programming has the following five values
       communication extreme programming stresses on the importance of the appropriate 
       kind of communication  face to face discussion with the aid of a white board or other
       drawing mechanism
       simplicity xp focuses on keeping the design of the system as simple as possible so that 
            it is easier to maintain support and revise
       feedback through constant feedback about their previous efforts teams can identify
      areas for improvement and revise their practices
       courage xp stresses on gathering courage to raise organizational issues that reduce
      your teams effectiveness 
       respect the members of a team should respect each other in order to communicate with each other provide and accept feedback that honors your relationship and to work together to identify simple designs and solutions
      
   oo     adaptive software development asd
       adaptive software development is a method to build complex software and system 
       with overall emphasis being on the dynamics of selforganizing teams interpersonal
       collaboration and individual and team learning
       characteristics
       asd lifecycle incorporates the following phases
       speculation the first phase of asd lifecycle involves initiation of project and planning the project plan uses project initiation information like project requirements user needs customer mission statement etc to define a set of release cycles that the project wants
       collaboration this phase involves collaboration and communication between different team members while ensuring that individual creative thinking is encouraged in this phase team members are expected to criticize without animosity assist without resentment and communicate problems to find an effective solution
       learning  learning helps the workers to increase their level of understanding over the project this ensures that any overestimation of their own understanding of the technology which may not lead to the desired result can be avoided
       
   oo     feature driven development
       feature driven development is a modeldriven shortiteration process that was built
       around software engineering best practices such as domain object modeling
       developing by feature and code ownership the blending of these practices that
      resulted in a cohesive whole is the best characteristic of fdd
      characteristics
       feature driven development begins by establishing an overall model shape which will
      result in a feature list the features are small useful in the eyes of the client results
       it then continues with a series of twoweek plan by feature design by feature build by
      feature iterations
       fdds main purpose is to deliver tangible working software in a timely manner
      repeatedly
       the advantage of using fdd is that it is scalable even to large teams due to the concept
      of just enough design initially jedi
       because of its featurecentric process fdd is a great solution to maintain control for
      incremental and inherently complex agile project management
