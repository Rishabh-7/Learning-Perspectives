                                     scrum
scrum is a framework that helps teams work together it encourages teams to learn through experiences self organize while working on a problem and reflect their wins and losses for continuous improvement
scrum relies on selforganizing which means there is no overall team leader who decides for everyone and the problem to be solved these issues are decided by the team as a whole        and a crossfunctional team which means everyone is needed to take a part from idea to implementation of the project
in scrum instead of providing a complete and detailed description of how everything is to be solved and done on solving a problem almost everything is left up to the team
                              process of scrum  
according to scrum projects progress via a series of sprints at the start of a sprint meeting team members figure out how many items they can commit to and then create a sprint backlog the decided work is done tested and integrated into the evolving product
on each day of the sprint all team members should attend a daily scrum meeting during the meeting team members share the work they have done will do on that day and identify the obstruction to the progress of the project at the end of the meeting reviews are also taken from scrummaster and product owner
the meeting is an opportunity to reflect on the sprint and identify the ways and opportunities to improve
                                    pros 
   oo    increase the quality of projects to be delivered
   oo    coping from the changes in a better way
   oo    providing better estimates while spending less time in organising them
   oo    be more in control of the project schedule and state


                               lean development
elimination of waste is the main principle of lean development
lean software development is an agile framework based on optimising development time and resources eliminating waste and ultimately delivering only what the product needs
also known as minimum viable product mvp
in mvp the team releases a basic version of its product to the market and takes feedback from the users about the product and then iterates back on the given feedback
the structure of lean products is iterative as it follows agile methodology
developers pay great attention to testing as their main focus is to deliver high quality products
                                    pros 
   oo    the approach followed allows more functionality to be delivered in less time
   oo    unnecessary activities are eliminated and thus the cost can be reduced
   oo    it gives power to the development team to take decisions which hereby boost their morale
                                    cons 
   oo    lean development heavily depends on the development team reducing its scalability with respect to other frameworks
   oo    it depends on strong documentation and faults in the same can result in development errors and mistakes

                                         
                                        
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                           extreme programming xp
extreme programming is an agile development methodology whose main aim is to improve software quality and its ability to properly adapt to the changing needs of the customers and clients
extreme programming aims to provide frequent releases throughout the life cycle of a project and follows an iterative approach allowing both customers and team members to examine and review the projects process throughout the lifecycle of software development 
user stories are maintained as a mandatory part in xp as the whole development and process is done following these maintained user stories
                                    rules 
   oo    planning
   oo    managing
   oo    designing
   oo    coding 
   oo    testing
                                    pros 
   oo    saves time and cost required for project realisation
   oo    whole process of xp is transparent and accountable
   oo    constant feedback
   oo    simple design
                                    cons 
   oo    doesnt measure code quality assurance
   oo    defect documentation is not always good
   oo    it is not the best option if programmers are geographically distant


                                       
                                       
                         adaptive software development asd
it is a direct outgrowth of an earlier agile framework rapid application development rad
adaptive software development is a software development process whose principle and aim is to quickly and effectively adapt to changing requirements by evolving their products with lightweight planning and continuous learning
it replaces the traditional waterfall cycle with a repeating series of three phase processes  speculate collaborate and learn cycles
its characteristics are  mission focused feature based iterative risk driven and change tolerant
                                    pros 
   oo    focused on the end users
   oo    allows delivery to be ontime or even earlier
   oo    encourages more transparency between clients and developer teams
                                    cons 
   oo    demands excessive involvement of users
   oo    integrates testing at every phase which increases the cost of the project
   oo    focus on rapid iterating and continuous feedback can lead to deviation in the scope of the project to be developed 

                                         
                                       


                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                        feature driven development fdd

fdd is an incremental and iterative software development process
it is a lightweight or agile method for developing software it is customer centric with a goal of delivering efficient results often
fdd encourages status reporting at all levels which helps to track progress and results
features are a fundamental piece of fdd as user stories are to scrum
fdd values documentation more than other methodologies which also creates differences in meetings roles
fdd is typically used in largescale development projects some steps that are followed are
   oo    develop the overall model
   oo    build feature list
   oo    plan by feature
   oo    design by feature
   oo    build by feature
                                    pros 
   oo    rapid development as it is a simple five step process
   oo    larger teams allow them to move forward with continuous success
   oo    predefined development standards so development is quick
                                    cons 
   oo    doesnt work efficiently for smaller projects
   oo    highly dependent on lead developers
