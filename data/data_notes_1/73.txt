scrum
scrum is an agile development methodology or framework used primarily for development of software with a goal of achieving the end product within  weeks time it is a widely used methodology in which the project progresses via a series of sprints these sprints are time bound not exceeding a month most commonly they last for  weeks duration a scrum team consists of   about  plus or minus  members a meeting is planned at the start of a sprint where in the team members figure out how many items they can commit to and a list of tasks that are to be accomplished during the sprint this is known as a sprint backlog daily scrum or team up meetings are to be done for a period of  minutes
typical sprint phases include
   oo    product backlog this consists of a list of functionalities with short descriptions derived from description and roadmap of project
   oo    sprint backlog this contains a list of product backlog items for which the development team commits to deliver as part of a particular sprint
   oo    sprint planning this defines the duration and the manner in which the sprint meetings are to be held and also addresses to resource and project planning agendas
   oo    sprint defined period of time in which the work has to be completed
the scrum framework is heuristic and is based on continuous learning and adjustment to changing factors organisations that exercise this methodology experience
   oo    higher productivity
   oo    better quality of products
   oo    reduced time to market
   oo    improved stakeholder satisfaction
   oo    better team dynamics
   oo    happier employees

scrum consists of three roles
       product owner person responsible for product vision and makes decisions on whether or not the products are ready to be shipped
       scrummaster facilitates the scrum process and enforces time bounds
       engineeringdevelopment team this consists of about  members responsible for completion of tasks
while scrum is structured it is not entirely rigid and there exists some form of flexibility as its execution can be tailored to meet the needs of any organisation clear communication transparency and dedication for continuous improvement are must for achieving success for any team or organisation employing the scrum framework



 lean development
also known as minimum viable productmvp lean software development is an agile framework based on optimizing development time and resources eliminating waste and ultimately delivering only what product needs the philosophy behind lean methodology is about smart development that is improving virtually everything by eliminating anything that doesnt bring value to the customer a streamlined approach is followed in this methodology that allows more functionality to be delivered in less time
lsd is broken down into seven main principles that highlight the working of this development methodology
       eliminating waste anything that contributes no value to the customer is regarded as waste such as partially done work inventory extra features defects etc
       amplifying learning software development is a continuous learning process based on iterations when writing code instead of adding more documentation or detailed planning different ideas could be tried by writing the code and building on it the iteration process is sped up by usage of short iteration cycles each coupled with refactoring and integration testing
       deferring commitment due to the involvement of uncertainty in the process of software development decisions should be delayed as much as possible that can lead to better results achieved through setbased or optionbased approach
       delivering fast in the current era of technology survival is much more dependent on the rate at which the end product is delivered faster the better sooner the endproduct is delivered with no defects or errors leads to faster feedbacks that can be incorporated in next iterations
       empowering the team the lean approach is based on agile principles of building products around motivated individuals and trusting them in getting the job done people are not treated just as mere resources but are valued on a larger scale
       building integrity there should be a balance between flexibility maintainability efficiency and responsiveness that can be achieved by understanding the problem domain and solving it at the same time and one of the major ways to work towards integral architecture is refactoring
       optimizing the whole lean thinking has to be understood well by all  members of the project before implementing in a concrete or real life situation think bug act smallfail fast and lean rapidly  these slogans summarize the importance of understanding the field




 extreme programming
extreme programming is an agile software development framework that aims at production of higher quality software keeping in view appropriate engineering practices to achieve its goal
it regards software development project as a system  of four control variables which are as follows
   oo    cost this describes the amount of money to be spent keeping in view the available resources
   oo    time this determines when the system is to be released
   oo    quality this describes the overall correctness of the system experienced form users customers point of view
   oo    scope this determines the amount of functionality that will be required
      time is the central variable in xp with all the other values having some form of functional dependency on it
xp also defines five values which are used as guidelines throughout the development they are
   oo    communication good communication is one of the key factors necessary for the success of software development customers need to communicate the requirements to the developers while developers need to commute to each other so as to achieve quality end products
   oo    simplicity  xp strives for simple systems this means they should be as simple as possible but at the same time they must not compromise on quality and should work properlyxp also strives for simplicity in methodology
   oo    feedback xp is a feedbackdriven process through constant feedbacks about previous efforts teams can identify areas of improvement and revise their practices feedback also supports simple design
   oo    courage xp includes courage as well as a certain amount of aggressiveness courage is needed because a lot of rules and practices are extreme in a way that they go against tradition or wisdom of software engineering
   oo    respect the members of the team should have mutual respect for each other in order to promote a cordial working environment so as to accomplish goals
      
      
      
      
      
 adaptive software developmentasd
      asd aims at enabling teams to adapt to requirement changes quickly and effectively and is a direct outgrowth of an earlier agile framework rad it focuses on human collaboration and self organisation which helps to build a complex software and system jim highsmith and sam bayer are credited for the invention of asd methodology
      this methodology focuses on end users leading to better and intuitive products while encouraging more transparency between developers and clients however it also requires extensive user involvement which is difficult to achieve
      
      phases of asd
      the practices of asd are driven by a belief in continuous adaptation  a different philosophy and a different life cycle  geared to accepting continuous change as a norm
      in this process the static plandesign is replaced by dynamic speculatecollaboratelearn lifecycle
         oo          speculation in asd the term plan is replaced by speculate acknowledging the uncertainty of complex problems and encouraging exploration and experimentation iteration with short cycles are also encouraged speculate gives us more room to explore to make clear the realisation that we are unsure of
         oo          collaboration the second conceptual component of asd is collaboration which needs the workers to be motivated complex applications are not built they evolve complex applications require that a larger volume of information to be collected analysed and applied to the problem
         oo          learning once we admit to ourselves that we are flexible then learning practices  the learn part of the life cycle becomes vital for success
            
            this life cycle defined above has six basic characteristics
                               mission focused
                               feature based
                               iterative
                               timeboxed
                               risk driven
                               change tolerant




 feature driven development

fdd was introduced by jeff de luca and peter coad in  and is one of the agile software development methodologies that has emerged in the last decade or so  as an alternative to the traditional waterfall development model so as to avoid the weaknesses of the waterfall model by doing iterative development
fdd is an agile highly adaptive software development process that 
   oo    supports high iterations that are short
   oo    emphasizes on quality on all the steps of production
   oo    delivers frequently and tangible working results at all steps
   oo    provides accurate and meaningful progress and status information with minimum overhead and disruption for developers

there are six primary roles on an fdd projectthese are
       project manager
       chief architect
       development manager
       chief programmer
       class owner
       domain expert
an individual can take on one or more roles

the fdd life cycle involves the following key steps
   oo    developing an overall model
   oo    building feature list
   oo    planning by feature
   oo    designing by feature
   oo    building by feature
      
this type of development is advantageous as it is highly adaptive and greatly stresses on designing and modeling aspects of the project however it does not address to issues related to project criticality
