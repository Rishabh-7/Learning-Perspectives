write short notes on following
 scrum
      scrum is a project management approach used in agile development it favours moving projects forward via shortterm blocks of work called sprints which are usually confined to twoweek intervals teams working with this framework are selforganizing and not topdown or hierarchical in nature scrumspecific roles include the scrum master essentially a team guide and the product owner who represents the business and customers it is easy to understand and allows rapid feedback and issues to be brought up through daily meetings often this framework can place a high degree of pressure on the team due to the frequent and short deadlines
      
 lean development
      it is an agile framework based on optimizing development time and resources eliminating waste and ultimately delivering only what the product needs this approach is also referred to as the minimum viable product strategy in which a team releases a bareminimum version of its product to the market learns from users what they like dont like and want to be added and then iterates based on this feedback its streamlined approach allows more functionality to be delivered in less time it eliminates unnecessary activity and as a result can reduce costs the development team gets empowered to make decisions which can also boost morale and confidence
      
 extreme programming xp
      this agile framework focusses on emphasizing the production of higherquality software to please customers as well making life better for the engineers who are developing it the main characteristics of xp include dynamically changing software requirements using a small development team and leveraging technology that facilitates automated unit and functional tests it can help cut costs for software development organizations the team members are accountable to the team for their work the emphasis on qualityoflife issues helps boost employee morale and retention although it does not place emphasis on code quality which can lead to defects in early iterations it is also not ideal if developers are not in the same location
      
 adaptive software development asd
      this framework is a direct outgrowth of an earlier agile framework rapid application development it aims to enable teams to quickly and effectively adapt to changing requirements or market needs by evolving their products with lightweight planning and continuous learning the asd approach encourages teams to develop according to a threephase process speculate collaborate learn it focused on the end users which can lead to better and more intuitive products it allows for ontime and even early delivery also it encourages more transparency between developers and clients further it demands extensive user involvement which can be difficult to facilitate it requires testing into every stage which can add to a projects costs the emphasis on rapid iterating and continuous feedback can lead to scope creep
      
 feature driven development
      it is a type of agile framework that organizes software development around making progress on features features in the fdd context though are not necessarily product features in the commonly understood sense they are similar to the scrum framework int terms of user stories for example the login process might be considered a feature in the feature driven development methodology it involves a simple fivestep process allowing for more rapid development it also allows larger teams to move products forward with continuous success it involves less written documentation which can lead to confusion and does not work efficiently for smaller projects and is also highly dependent on lead developers or programmers further it uses predefined development standards so that teams are able to move quickly
