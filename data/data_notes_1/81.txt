      usage
      scrum may be the best choice when the exact amount of work cant be estimated and the release date is not fixed   scrum is used for projects that require stakeholder feedback which may greatly affect project requirements  
      benefits
         oo          higher productivity
         oo          betterquality products

 cons
         oo          scrum often leads to scope creep  due to the lack of a definite enddate  
         oo          chances of project failure are high if individuals arent very committed or cooperative 
         oo          adapting scrum in large teams is challenging  
            components
                   the scrum team

         oo          product owner  key stakeholder or key user 
         oo          development team  anyone who participates in the creation of deliverables 
                 the scrum events
         oo          sprint planning meeting  scrum team selects the work they can complete during the coming sprint 
         oo          daily scrum  each day a brief meeting is conducted to set the context for each days work 
         oo          sprint retrospective  at the end of each sprint  a meeting is scheduled in which the team reflects on how well scrum is working for them and what changes they may wish to make 
         oo          sprint review meeting  team shows what they accomplished during the sprint  
       scrum artifacts  sprint backlog  items taken from product backlog for sprint  
       
  lean development  lean software development is an agile framework  based on optimizing development time and resources  eliminating waste and ultimately delivering only what the product needs  team releases a bareminimum version of its product to the market learns from users what they like  dont like and want to be added and then iterates based on this feedback  
  usage
 organisation must have an outstanding development team and trust that team implicitlyfor  this approach to be successful as it forces the team to ruthlessly cut away any activity that doesnt directly affect the final product  
 benefits
   oo    streamlined approach allows more functionality to be delivered in less time 
   oo    eliminates unnecessary activity and as a result can reduce costs 
   oo    empowers the development team to make decisions 
cons
   oo    heavily dependent on team members  can lead to failure if proper documentation is not maintained  

      extreme programming xp  an agile software development framework that aims to produce high quality software  and higher quality of life for the development team xp is set up for small groups of programmers 
usage
in many software environments dynamically changing requirements is the only constant  xp is used when customers dont have a firm idea of what the system should do and hence there are dynamic changes in requirements  the xp practices are set up to mitigate the risk and increase the likelihood of success 
benefits
   oo    whole process in xp is visible and accountable  developers commit what they will accomplish and show progress 
   oo    it allows companies to save costs and time required for project realization 
cons
   oo    this methodology does not measure code quality code assurance  it may cause defects in the initial code 

values
   oo    communication  xp stresses the importance of the appropriate kind of communication face to face communication with aim of a white board 
   oo    simplicity  keep the design of the system as simple as possible so that it is easier to maintain support and revise  
   oo    feedback  through constant feedback teams can identify areas for improvement and revise their practices  
   oo    courage  you need courage to accept and act on feedback even when its difficult to accept  
   oo    respect  team members should respect each other in order to communicate with each otherprovide and accept feedback

      
     adaptive software development asd  it is a method to build complex software and systems  asd focuses on human collaborations and selforganisation  
phases
   oo    speculation  project is initiated and planning is conducted  
   oo    collaboration  it needs the workers to be motivated  people working together must trust each others to criticize  assist  work as hard as possible  possession of skill set and communicate problems to find effective solutions  
   oo     learning  learning helps the workers to increase their level of understanding over the project   team has to increase their knowledge constantlyusing practices such as  technical reviews  project retrospective and customer focus groups  
      
      feature driven development fdd  organizes software development around making progress on features  
usage 
fdd is used while working on a largescale software project   but this methodology relies heavily on chief developers and has a topdown decision making approach 
project lifecycle 
   oo    develop an overall model
   oo    build a feature list
   oo    plan by feature
   oo    design by feature
   oo    build by feature


benefits
   oo    allows more rapid development 
   oo    allows larger teams to move products forward with continuous success 
   oo    leverages predefined development standards so teams are able to move quickly 
cons
   oo    does not work efficiently for smaller projects
   oo    less written documentation which can lead to confusion 
   oo    highly dependent on lead developers or programmers
