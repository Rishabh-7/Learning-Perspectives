       scrum
      definition
      scrum is a framework used to manage product development and other knowledge work scrum works best for longterm and complex projects that may require constant stakeholders feedback which may affect project requirements
      so when the exact amount of work and time limit of the project is not fixed scrum is one of the best choice
      components
         a          team size scrum development has a team of size between  to  all of which work together to complete the set of work they have collectively committed to complete within a sprint
         b          product owner product owner is often from
               i                someone from product management
               ii                a key stakeholder
               iii                a key user
         c          scrum master scrum master is responsible for making the team as productive as possible
         d          product backlog it is a list containing prioritised feature addition or changes to the product
         e          sprint planning meeting a sprint meeting is held at the start of each sprint during which the product owner presents the top item in the product backlog and team selects work that is to be completed in this sprint
         f          daily scrum a daily meeting during each day of sprint in which daily task or context to be completed is decided
         g          sprint review meeting a meeting held at the end of each sprint where the team shows the completed functionalities or work done during the sprint  
         h          sprint retrospective a meeting also held at the end of each sprint where the team reflects on how well scrum is working and also changes that may make it work even better
         i          sprint sprint is a timebox of one month or less duration during which a done useable or potentially releasable product increment is created
            
      scrum is structured in a way that allows teams to incorporate practices from other frameworks where they make sense for the teams context like extreme programming lean development etc

       lean development
      definition
      lean development is the application of lean principles to software development it is based on optimizing development time and resources eliminating waste and ultimately delivering only what the product needs
      the lean approach is also often called the minimum viable product mvp strategy in which a team releases a bareminimum version of its product to the market learns from users what they like dont like and want to be added and then iterates based on this feedback
      two of major goals of lean principle are
                   minimize waste
                   maximize value

advantages
         oo          streamlined approach allows more functionality to be delivered in less time
         oo          eliminates unnecessary activity and as a result can reduce costs
         oo          empowers the development team to make decisions which can also boost morale
            
      disadvantages
         oo          heavily depends on the team involved making it not as scalable as other frameworks
         oo          depends on strong documentation and failure to do so can result in development mistakes
            
            
       extreme programming xp
      definition
      extreme programming xp is a software development framework that aims to produce higher quality software and higher quality of life for the development team it is the most specific agile framework regarding appropriate practices for software development
      values
         oo          communication 
         oo          simplicity 
         oo          feedback
         oo          courage
         oo          respect

      characteristics
         oo          dynamically changing software requirements
         oo          risks caused by fixed time projects using new technology
         oo          small colocated extended development team
         oo          the technology you are using allows for an automated unit and functional test
            
       adaptive software development asd
      definition
      adaptive software development asd is a cyclical like evolutionary model with phase names that reflect the unpredictability of the complex systems it is a method to build complex systems and softwares it majorly focuses on human collaboration and selforganisation
      three of the phases of asd are

                   speculation
            during this phase the project is initiated and planning is conducted the project plan uses project initiation information like project requirements user needs customer mission statement etc to define a set of release cycles that the project wants
            
                   collaboration
            it is the difficult part of asd as it needs the workers to be motivated it collaborates communication and teamwork but emphasizes individualism as individual creativity plays a major role in creative thinking people working together must trust each other to
               oo                criticize without animosity
               oo                assist without resentment
               oo                work as hard as possible
               oo                possession of skill set
               oo                communicate problems to find effective solutions

                   learning
            the workers may have an overestimate of their own understanding of the technology which may not lead to the desired result learning helps the workers to increase their level of understanding over the project
      learning process is of  ways
                               focus groups
                               technical reviews
                               project postmortem
      
       feature driven development
      definition
      feature driven development fdd is a feature centric iterative and incremental approach with the goal of delivering tangible software results regularly and efficiently fdd encourages status reporting at all levels which helps in tracking progress and results
      fdd allows teams to update regularly and identify errors quickly which make fdd prone from  problems namely
         oo          confusion 
         oo          rework
      because of these advantages it became an ideal approach for longterm complex projects looking for a simple but comprehensive method
      some basic activities involved in fdd are
                   develop overall model
                   build feature list
                   plan by feature
                   design by feature
                   build by feature

      an overall model shape is formed during the first two steps while the final three are repeated for each feature the majority roughly  of effort during fdd will be spent on the fourth and fifth steps
      
      however the major difference here is that once a goal has been achieved teams organise their activities by features rather than the project milestones
