write short notes on following
   oo     scrum
           scrum is an agile framework for developing delivering and sustaining complex productswith an initial emphasis on software developmentit is a framework within which people can address complex adaptive problems while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible valuedue to its better satisfaction lower cost and lightweight it has wide variety of use and have  been used in fields fields like researches sales marketing and other advanced technologies                                      
      scrum is designed for teams of ten or fewer members who break their work into goals that can be completed within timeboxed iterations called sprints which is not  longer than one month and most commonly two weeksscrum works by delivering large projects in small chunksbitesized product increments that a crossfunctional team can begin and complete in one short timeboxed iterationas the one iteration completes the team decide the what to do next on the basis of the feedbacks and this reduces waste minimizes the risk
    benefits of scrum
       increases ability to manage changing priorities
       more alignment between business and it
       greater ability to incorporate changes
       provides better visibility into projects
       faster time to market
       better user satisfaction
       lower cost
       simple understanding
       lightweight
    scrum is dependent on the three pillars of empirical control process
       inspectionscrum reviews  retrospectives offer inspection opportunities
       adaptationscrum teams can adapt the product at the end of every sprint
       transparencyscrum provides transparency


   oo    lean development
lean software development also known as  the minimum viable product mvp strategy is an agile framework which is  based on optimizing development time and resources eliminating waste and ultimately the goal is to  deliver only what the product needslean principles got their start in manufacturing as a way to optimize the production line to minimize waste and maximize value to the customer but its goal of of repeatable process and dedication to get the standard quality made it famous for the software development alsoin the lean development  developing team releases a bareminimum version of its product to the market learns from users and their feedback what they like dont like and want to be added and then iterates based on these feedback
lean development depends on the following lean principles
       eliminate the wasteeliminate the things which donot add any value to the customer
       create knowledgeencourages lean teams to provide the infrastructure to properly document and retain valuable learning
       get the best quality of the product
       respect peopleteaches how to communicatehandle conflict and onboard new hires
       fast deliverbuild a simple product and deliver to the customer and then increment it later with the feedbacks
       optimization of whole
       defer commitmentkeep option open and continuously collect information and then take any decision rather than making any decision
 benefits of lean development
       rationalizes and simplifies the development process
       increases team involvement rate
       prevents any loss



   oo    extreme programming xp
extreme programming xp is an agile software development methodology that aims to generates higher quality softwarealong with the higher quality of life of the development team and can easily adapt the ongoing changes in the demand of the customer ie extreme programming is a software development methodology which improve the software quality on the basis of changes  user stories his requirements and demands
benefits of extreme programmingxp
       slipped schedules and achievable development cycles ensures timely deliveries
       extreme programming assists to create software faster and better
       misunderstanding the business and domain
       increase in staff turnover
       simplicitydeveloper develops extremely simple codes which can be modify easily any time
       changes are inevitable in extreme programming and accommodated at any point of time
       costs incurred in changes ongoing testing makes sure the changes do not break the current functionality
       the whole process of extreme programming is visible and accountable
       extreme programming increases customer satisfaction
         extreme programmingxp is based on the frequent iterations in which the developers implement the modifications made through the user storiesuser story is a conventional description by the user about a feature of the required system thier demands and requirementsit does not includes fine details such as the different scenarios that can occur laterthe basic activities that are followed in software development by using extreme programming model are codingcommunicationtestingdesigning and feedback

   oo    adaptive software development asd
      adaptive software development is a direct outgrowth of an earlier agile frameworkrapid application developmentradit is a method to build a complex software and systemsit focuses on selforganisation and human collaboration
             life cycle of asd consist of three phases
                   speculate the term plan is known as speculate in the asdduring this phase the project is initiated and planning of the project is conductedint initiation uses the information like user demandsrequirements to set the cycles to release it later
                   collaboration  complex applications are not builtthey evolvecomplex applications require large volumes of data to be analyzed and to applied on the problems so it needs the workers to be motivatedit collaborates communication and teamwork but emphasizes individualism so that people can work together with full trust on each other without criticize assist without resentment work hard as much as possible and communication
                   learnthis is tha vital for the success of the project teams and individuals has to constantly increase their knowledge by the practices such as technical reviewsretrospectives and customer focus group
                          reviews should be done after each iterationsand both the customer 
                       developers examine their assumptions and use the results of each cycle
      advantages of asd
             a better and stronger end product
             a userfirst approach which leads to more intuitive piece of software
             increases transparency between developers and customers
             more likely to be on time
      



   oo          feature driven development
      feature driven developmentfdd is an agile framework that organizes software development around making progress on featuresit is lightweight or agile method for developing softwareit is customer centric iterative and incremental with the goal of delivering tangible software results often and efficiently
      feature driven development allows teams to update the project regularly and identify errors quickly and customersusers are provided with information and substantial results at any time demanded
      in the fdd  basic activities exists
                   develop overall model
                   build feature list
                   plan by feature
                   design by feature
                   build by feature
            there are  stages in the feature driven development
                   gathering of data collect content and context of the project so that model can be developed clearly
                   development of overall modelby using the thesis as a guide the team now develops detailed domain model which can be later merged into the overall model 
                   build a features listby using the information assembled in the first step we create a list of required features
            advantages of feature driven development
             featuredriven development helps to move larger size projects and    obtain repeatable success
              it supports multiple teams working in parallel
             it is well defined progress and reporting capabilities
             the fdd helps to achieve target faster in easiest manner
             promotes individual code ownership
