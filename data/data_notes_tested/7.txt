scrum

scrum is an agile project management methodology or framework used primarily for software
development projects with the goal of delivering new software capability every  weeks it is one
of the approaches that influenced the agile manifesto which articulates a set of values and
principles to guide decisions on how to develop higherquality software faster
scrum addresses complexity in work by making information transparent so that people can inspect
and adapt based on current conditions rather than predicted conditions this allows teams to
address the common pitfalls of a waterfall development process chaos resulting from constantly
changing requirements underestimation of time resources and cost compromises on software
quality and inaccurate progress reporting transparency of common terms and standards is required
in scrum development to ensure that what is being delivered is what was expected frequent
inspection ensures progress and detects variances early on so that adjustments can be made quickly
components of scrum development
the scrum team
 the product owner
the product owner is the projects key stakeholder or a spokesperson for the customer there is
only one product owner who conveys the overall mission and vision of the product which the team
is building
 the scrummaster
with no hierarchial authority over the team but rather more of a facilitator the scrummaster
ensures that the team adheres to scrum theory practices and rules the scrummaster protects the
team by doing anything possible to help the team perform at the highest level this may include
removing impediments facilitating meetings and helping the product owner groom the backlog
 the development team
the development team is a selforganizing crossfunctional group armed with all of the skills to
deliver shippable increments at the completion of each sprint there are no titles in the
development team and no one including the scrummaster tells the development team how to
turn product backlog items into potentially shippable increments
scrum events ceremonies
 the sprint
a sprint is a timeboxed period during which specific work is completed and made ready for review
sprints are usually  weeks long but can be as short as one week
 sprint planning sprint
planning team meetings are timeboxed events that determine which product backlog items will be
delivered and how the work will be achieved

 the daily standup
the daily standup is a short communication meeting no more than  minutes in which each
team member quickly and transparently covers progress since the last standup planned work
before the next meeting and any impediments that may be blocking his or her progress
 the sprint review
the sprint review is the showandtell or demonstration event for the team to present the work
completed during the sprint the product owner checks the work against predefined acceptance
criteria and either accepts or rejects the work the stakeholders or clients give feedback to ensure
that the delivered increment met the business need
 the retrospective
the retrospective or retro is the final team meeting in the sprint to determine what went well
what didnt go well and how the team can improve in the next sprint attended by the team and the
scrummaster the retrospective is an important opportunity for the team to focus on its overall
performance and identify strategies for continuous improvement on its processes
scrum artifacts
product backlog
the product backlog is the single most important document that outlines every requirement for a
system project or product the product backlog can be thought of as a todo list consisting of work
items each of which produces a deliverable with business value backlog items are ordered in terms
of business value by the product owner
sprint backlog
a sprint backlog is the specific list of items taken from the product backlog which are to be
completed in a sprint
increment
an increment is the sum of all product backlog items that have been completed since the last
software release while it is up to the product owner to decide on when an increment is released it
is the teams responsibility to make sure everything that is included in an increment is ready to be
released this is also referred to as the potentially shippable increment psi
scrum rules
the rules of agile scrum should be completely up to the team and governed by what works best for
their processes the best agile coaches will tell teams to start with the basic scrum events listed
above and then inspect and adapt based on your teams unique needs so there is continuous
improvement in the way teams work together



lean development

lean software development lsd is an agile framework based on optimizing development time
and resources eliminating waste and ultimately delivering only what the product needs the lean
approach is also often referred to as the minimum viable product mvp strategy in which a team
releases a bareminimum version of its product to the market learns from users what they like
dont like and want to be added and then iterates based on this feedback
many organizations have found the lsd methodology to be an excellent approach to software
development because of its streamlining of the process and forcing the team to ruthlessly cut away

any activity that doesnt directly affect the final product but an organization must have an
outstanding development team and trust that team implicitly for this approach to be successful
additionally by waiting until the last minute to make decisions the cost of change remains much
less iterative development is utilized to deliver new applications or enhancements as quick as
possible integrity is built into the software to ensure architecture and that system components flow
well together organizations incorporate lean development principles to achieve continuous
improvement as changes are rapidly implemented
lean software development is a set of principles that can be applied to software development to
decrease programming effort budgeting and defect rates by one third the principles were adapted
from lean manufacturing by mary and tom poppendieck this approach is beneficial to an
organization because agile iterations eliminate extensive preplanned specifications user stories
rather than large upfront specs are easily understood by each team member and simpler to
communicate
lean development makes it possible to gain information straight from the source therefore
eliminating the common problem of producing software that does not address the customers needs
short iterations provide an opportunity to communicate small sets of plans up front and allow the
team to make decisions in order to adapt to unforeseen circumstances organizations that have the
ability to complete fast simple improvements in the shortest time frame gain powerful decisionmaking benefits



extreme programming xp

extreme programming xp is one of the most important software development framework of agile
models it is used to improve software quality and responsive to customer requirements the
extreme programming model recommends taking the best practices that have worked well in the
past in program development projects to extreme levels
basic principles of extreme programming xp is based on the frequent iteration through which
the developers implement user stories user stories are simple and informal statements of the
customer about the functionalities needed a user story is a conventional description by the user
about a feature of the required system it does not mention finer details such as the different
scenarios that can occur the development team may decide to build a spike for some feature a
spike is a very simple program that is constructed to explore the suitability of a solution being
proposed it can be considered similar to a prototype some of the basic activities that are followed
during software development by using xp model are given below
 coding the concept of coding which is used in xp model is slightly different from traditional
coding here coding activity includes drawing diagrams modeling that will be transformed
into code scripting a webbased system and choosing among several alternative solutions
 testing xp model gives high importance on testing and considers it be the primary factor to
develop a faultfree software
 listening the developers needs to carefully listen to the customers if they have to develop a
good quality software sometimes programmers may not have the depth knowledge of the
system to be developed so it is desirable for the programmers to understand properly the
functionality of the system and they have to listen to the customers
 designing without a proper design a system implementation becomes too complex and very
difficult to understand the solution thus it makes maintenance expensive a good design results
elimination of complex dependencies within a system so effective use of suitable design is
emphasized

 feedback one of the most important aspects of the xp model is to gain feedback to understand
the exact customer needs frequent contact with the customer makes the development effective
 simplicity the main principle of the xp model is to develop a simple system that will work
efficiently in present time rather than trying to build something that would take time and it may
never be used it focuses on some specific features that are immediately needed rather than
engaging time and effort on speculations of future requirements



adaptive software development asd

adaptive software development is a method to build complex software and system asd focuses
on human collaboration and selforganisation
adaptive software development practices provide ability to accommodate change and are
adaptable in turbulent environments with products evolving with little planning and learning
phases of asd life cycle
adaptive software development is cyclical like the evolutionary model with the phase names
reflecting the unpredictability in the complex systems the phases in the adaptive development life
cycle are 


speculate



collaborate


learn
these three phases reflect the dynamic nature of adaptive software development the adaptive
development explicitly replaces determinism with emergence it goes beyond a mere change in
lifecycle to a deeper change in management style adaptive software development has a dynamic
speculatecollaboratelearn lifecycle
the adaptive software development lifecycle focuses on results not tasks and the results are
identified as application features
speculate
the term plan is too deterministic and indicates a reasonably high degree of certainty about the
desired result the implicit and explicit goal of conformance to plan restricts the managers ability
to steer the project in innovative directions
in adaptive software development the term plan is replaced by the term speculate while
speculating the team does not abandon planning but it acknowledges the reality of uncertainty in
complex problems speculate encourages exploration and experimentation iterations with short
cycles are encouraged
collaborate
complex applications are not built they evolve complex applications require that a large volume
of information be collected analyzed and applied to the problem turbulent environments have
high rates of information flow hence complex applications require that a large volume of
information be collected analyzed and applied to the problem this results in diverse knowledge
requirements that can only be handled by team collaboration

collaborate would require the ability to work jointly to produce results share knowledge or make
decisions
in the context of project management collaboration portrays a balance between managing with
traditional management techniques and creating and maintaining the collaborative environment
needed for emergence
learn
the learn part of the lifecycle is vital for the success of the project team has to enhance their
knowledge constantly using practices such as 


technical reviews



project retrospectives


customer focus groups
reviews should be done after each iteration both the developers and customers examine their
assumptions and use the results of each development cycle to learn the direction of the next
we observe the following from an adaptive framework


it is difficult to collaborate without learning or to learn without collaborating



it is difficult to speculate without learning or to learn without speculating


it is difficult to speculate without collaborating or to collaborate without
speculating



feature driven development

feature driven development fdd is an agile framework that as its name suggests organizes
software development around making progress on features features in the fdd context though
are not necessarily product features in the commonly understood sense they are rather more akin
to user stories in scrum in other words complete the login process might be considered a feature
in the feature driven development fdd methodology
if youre with a big corporation or are working on a largescale software project fdd might be
right for your project but this methodology relies heavily on chief developers and has a topdown
decisionmaking approach as opposed to some of the other agile frameworks that are based more
on collective project ownership if that type of methodology fits your companys culture then
feature driven development is worth investigating
fdd was designed to follow a fivestep development process built largely around discrete
feature projects that project lifecycle looks like this
 develop an overall model
 build a features list
 plan by feature
 design by feature
 build by feature
pros of fdd
 simple fivestep process allows for more rapid development
 allows larger teams to move products forward with continuous success

 leverages predefined development standards so teams are able to move quickly
cons of fdd
 does not work efficiently for smaller projects
 less written documentation which can lead to confusion
 highly dependent on lead developers or programmers
