write short notes on
 scrum
scrum is an agile process framework created by jeff sutherland and ken schwaber meant to be
used for effective team collaboration on complex product development it is useful for any team
project with aggressive deadlines and complex requirements and is used in various disciplines
especially in software development
a scrum team is typically of  to  members  however scrum can be used by teams of any size
ranging from  person teams to teams of over  members in a scrum team for software
development the usual roles of programmer designer tester etc are discarded in the place of
these roles the participants are divided into
 product owner
the product owner is a single person that represents the projects key stakeholders users
customers or others that the product will affect and is responsible for maximizing the
value of the product resulting from the work of the development team
 development team
the development team are the professionals solely responsible for delivering a
potentially releasable increment of the product at the end of a sprint they are self
organizing and cross functional
 scrum master
the scrum master is responsible for maximizing productivity of the development team by
integrating scrum principles into the process removing obstacles to the progress of the
team preventing outside influence etc
as a part of the scrum process  some key artifacts are defined to maximize transparency of key
information and provide opportunities for inspection and adaptation these artifacts are
 product backlog
the product backlog is a prioritized list of desired features for the product the product
owner is the sole individual held accountable for the product backlog even if they
themselves have not created it



 sprint backlog
the sprint backlog is the set of product backlog items selected for the sprint in the sprint
planning meeting and a plan for delivering the expected product increment as part of the
sprint goal
 increment
an increment is a body of inspectabledone work that represents the sum of all product
backlog items completed during a sprint and the value of the increments of all previous
sprints
during the scrum process multiple predefined timeboxed events are used to maintain regularity
while minimizing the need for unnecessary meetings these scrum events are
 sprint
in scrum the project is released as done usable and potentially releasable product
increments created in a timebox of one month or less such a time box is called a sprint
 sprint planning
a sprint planning meeting is held at the start of each sprint in this meeting the scrum
team pulls work from the product backlog into the sprint backlog
 daily scrum
a brief meeting is held everyday in the sprint to set the context for each days work and
for keeping the team on track this is called the daily scrum
 sprint review
a sprint review meeting is held at the end of a sprint for the development team to
informally demonstrate the completed functionality
 sprint retrospective
a sprint retrospective is held at the end of each sprint where the entire scrum team
analyzes the efficiency of the scrum process so far and how they could increase this
efficiency

 lean development
lean development is an iterative agile methodology translated from the manufacturing industry
to optimize production and focuses specifically on the removal of waste ie nonvalue adding
activities from a process it was first introduced in software development by dr robert
charette in  and was popularized by mary and tom poppendieck in their book of the same
name
there are  core lean principles for building more efficient software products  these principles
are



 eliminate waste
anything that does not add value to the product for the customer is considered waste this
can include extra or wrong processes and features
 build quality
ensure that quality is built at the coding level and maintained by often refactoring this is
done to ensure that defects are prevented from the start rather than searched for near the
end
 amplify learning and create knowledge
expect the application to evolve over time and learn through an iterative process of
releasing functioning versions and collecting feedback from users
 defer critical decisionscommitments
irreversible decisions should be delayed to the last responsible moment so that they can
be made with the most relevant uptodate information in mind
 deliver fast
short development cycles are used to develop functioning versions to gather user
feedback and respond faster to customers needs
 respect people
respect is given to team members in the context of their opinions being valued without
them being micromanaged this not only leads to reduced frustration but also encourages
healthy and productive discussions related to key business decisions
 optimize the whole
the project should be viewed as a combination of teams or components working together
while considering where to optimize rather than looking at the components or teams
individually

 extreme programming xp
extreme programming is an agile software development framework used to improve software
quality and responsiveness to customer requirements while also improving the quality of life for
the development team it recommends taking best practices that have been proven to work in the
past to an extreme level
extreme programming consists of five core values namely
 communication
xp stresses on the appropriate kind of communication being a face to face discussion
with the aid of a drawing mechanism such as a white board and describes software
development to inherently be a team sport requiring knowledge transfer among team
members



 simplicity
simplicity implies the removal of waste and to focus on only known requirements during
design and development to make it easier to maintain support and revise as required in
the future
 feedback
paired with simplicity feedback allows the team to dynamically improve their practices
while also adjusting the product according to the customers needs going forward
 courage
courage entails team members having a bias for action in the face of fear whether it be
while raising organizational issues stopping the use of ageold practices if they reduce
the teams effectiveness or to scrap a hard built feature if there is a better alternative
available
 respect
respect should be maintained between team members to be able to effectively
communicate  provide and accept feedback and work together going forward

 adaptive software development asd
adaptive software development is a software development practice evolved from rapid
application development rad practices by jim highsmith in  it focuses on providing
the ability to accommodate change and adapt to turbulent environments with little planning and
learning
the asd life cycle consists of three phases namely
 speculate
the speculation phase is a non deterministic replacement for the planning phase of a
general software development life cycle during this phase the project is initiated and
planning is conducted while keeping uncertainty of the complex problem at hand in mind
this phase uses initiation information like requirements user needs etc to define a set of
short release cycles
 collaboration
due to the high rate of information flow that needs to be collected analyzed and applied
to the problem there is a requirement for the individual members of the team to
collaborate ie work jointly to produce results share knowledge and make decisions
while utilizing their individual skill sets
 learning
the learning phase is essential for the success of the project and requires the team to
increase their knowledge of the project technology using techniques such as
a focus groups


b technical reviews
c project retrospectives
to effectively use the learn phase the iterations need to be short so that the mistakes the
team is learning from are small rather than large

 feature driven development fdd
feature driven development fdd is an agile process that organizes software development
around the progress made on features  where a feature is a small clientvalued functiontask
similar to user stories in scrum
the fdd life cycle consists of five stages
 develop an overall model
the domain and development teams alongside a chief architect focus more on the
overall scope of the product rather than going into featureheavy detail ie the team
focuses on capturing the target audience the context the software should be used in and
the necessary structure
 build a features list
a team of chief programmers decompose the overall model developed in the previous
phase into a number of areas and then further into a number of activities feature sets
where each step within an activity is defined as a feature
 plan by feature
in this stage important decisions related to feature implementation are taken  feature
sets are assigned to chief programmers and key classes are assigned to developers
 design by feature
in this stage the chief programmer forms a feature team by identifying class owners
likely to be involved in the development of selected features  refines the object model
based on sequence diagrams and assigns the developers to write class and method
prologues at the end of the phase a design inspection is held
 build by feature
in this stage the class owners work with the design package produced in the previous
phase to implement the items necessary for their class to support the design for the
features in the work package this code is unit tested and inspected according to the chief
programmer and finally permitted to build
the fdd framework leads to clearer project management minimizes complexity and leads to
the building of better products rapidly it is developed while keeping larger teams in mind and
will not work as efficiently for smaller projects
