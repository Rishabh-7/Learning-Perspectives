 scrum
scrum is an iterative and incremental approach for projects or application
development it is structured in cycles of work called sprints which generally lasts
less than a month requirements are prioritized by scrum team and commits to
complete the selected items in the sprint during the sprint the chosen items do not
change whole scrum team gathers every day for analysis of progress on sprint end
the team reviews the sprint with stakeholders and give their feedback feedback
items are completed in the next sprint

roles in scrum
roles in scrum team are
 the product owner tells the team on which items to work on product owner is
responsible for the return of investment for the product
 the team it is crossfunctional it is a selforganizing team which has the people
who have the potential to develop the product they have a high degree of
autonomy and accountability
 the scrummaster the scrummaster helps the product group learn and apply
scrum to achieve business value

scrum ceremonies
 sprint planning it is done at the start of a sprint in which requirements and

timeline is decided it also has a doubt session
 daily scrum it is a short meeting to keep everyone updated about the workitems
 product backlog  of each scrum is dedicated to the refinement of the
product backlog in this remaining work item are done which can be feedback
items also
 sprint review this meeting is done to retrospect sprint and check scope for
improvement

 lean development
lean software development is an iterative agile methodology which was developed
by mary and tom poppendieckaken it is derived from lean manufacturing whose
goal is to have a simplified and streamlined approach lean software development
methodology is used to reduce the cost of the project by reducing waste items it is
widely used in it industry to reduce programming time lean development is based
on following principles








eliminating waste
building quality in
amplifying knowledge
delaying commitment
delivering fast
respecting people
optimizing the whole thing

benefits of lean development methodology
 it is a faster way to develop a product with less budget and other resources
efficiency is improved by a considerable margin it allows to teams to have a more
stream lined approach
 scope of learning learning is increased with code reviewing lean development
uses pair programming with which skillset of developers is enhanced
 fast delivery lean development focuses on small but fast releases which allows
developers to study the marketcustom behavior this allows a product to be
developed incrementally along with continuous feedback
 lean also tells to develop unit test cases alongside the code development which
means testing can be done alongside the development thus reducing the time spent
on testing the products

pitfalls of using lean development methodology
 implementation is not as it easy as it seems leader has to decide the goals which
team can understand and do within timeframe it requires complete knowledge
of the organization

 extreme programming xp
extreme programming is developed by kent beck extreme programming is a
structured approach toward developing software quickly as well as maintaining
quality it has high customer involvement multiple feedback loops and continuous
planning in xp a working incremental software update is given every  weeks it
also includes pair programming which allows the skills to flow across the
developers

principles of extreme programming are












small releases
simple design
testing
refactoring
metaphor
pair programming
collective code ownership
continuous integration
weeks with  hours
onsite customer
maintained standard for code

benefits of extreme programming
 focus on continuous customer involvement increase transparency reduces time
for development and allows to fix issues immediately
 reduces time to incur changes with active customer involvement and running
predetermined unit tests alongside development
 reduced misunderstanding between customer and development team
 changes can be accommodated anytime during the development

roles in extreme programming
 customer owner of the product has set of requirements and budget
 developers team which develops the product everyone but customer is
developer
 coach leads the team about the increment in the product
 tracker tracks the standards timeline and scope for improvement

 adaptive software development asd
adaptive software development is a cyclic software development model it is an
upgraded version on rapid application development rad asd means to develop
a new software by adapting to the available projects which are used as a template
which leads to a faster development cycle
phases of adaptive software development
 speculation this is the planning phase of the development complete project
path from requirements user needs timeline to release cycles are decided in this
phase short iterations are encouraged in planning to avoid scaled mistakes
 collaboration evolved applications require analyzing large volumes of
information which can be applied to solve a problem this requires wide
knowledge requirements that can be achieved only with team collaboration
collaborate enables teams to wok jointly
 learn reviews are done after each iteration which helps teams to enhance
knowledge it also helps in deciding next work items among the teams

benefits of adaptive software development
 focuses on end users which helps in better products
 timely delivery scope for early delivery also
 transparency between customer and developers

pitfalls of adaptive software development
 unit test integration at every stage which increases the cost for development
 continuous feedback from customer faster development and scope for rapid
iterative may lead to slope creep
 requires user involvement which is not always available

 feature driven development
feature driven developments is a stakeholder focused development strategy a
feature is a client valued functions it is similar to user stories in scrum it is five
step development process and follows standards which are easier to keep unlike
scrum it uses backlog items or user features to develop one by one deciding
features helps in faster development times

processes in feature driven development






develop overall model
create a list of features to include
plan features one by one
design features one by one
build features one by one

benefits of feature driven development
 feature hierarchy helps in prioritizing which features need to be developed first
 feature list decomposes the user requirements which helps in avoiding slope
creep and deciding time frame for development correctly
 feature driven development uses unified modeling language uml which
helps in expressing feature requirements and reduces miscommunication
among large teams
